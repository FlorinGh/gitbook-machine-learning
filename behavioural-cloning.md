# Behavioural Cloning

## **Challenge**

Train a convolution neural network to clone driving behaviour using training sets recorded in realistic video games.

In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. You will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

We have provided a simulator where you can steer a car around a track for data collection. You'll use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

## **Actions**

* use the simulator to collect data of good driving behaviour
* build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* test that the model successfully drives around track without leaving the road

### Tools

This project used a combination of Python, numpy, matplotlib, openCV, scikit-learn and Keras GPU. These tools are installed in a anaconda environment and ran in a Jupyter notebook.

The complete project implementation is available here: [https://github.com/FlorinGh/SelfDrivingCar-ND-pr3-Behavioral-Cloning](https://github.com/FlorinGh/SelfDrivingCar-ND-pr3-Behavioral-Cloning).
