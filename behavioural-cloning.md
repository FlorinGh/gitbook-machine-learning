# Behavioural Cloning

## **Challenge**

Train a convolution neural networks to clone driving behaviour using a realistic game to record training sets

## **Actions**

* use the simulator to collect data of good driving behaviour
* build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* test that the model successfully drives around track without leaving the road

## **Results**
