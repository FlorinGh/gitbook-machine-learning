# Behavioural Cloning

## **Challenge**

Train a convolution neural network to clone driving behaviour using training sets recorded in realistic video games.

A driving simulator created in Unity is provided; the user can steer a car around a track using the keyboard or a joystick; in record mode screen shots of the road and steering angles are saved.  Use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

## **Actions**

* use the simulator to collect data of good driving behaviour
* build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* test that the model successfully drives around track without leaving the road

### Tools

This project used a combination of Python, numpy, matplotlib, openCV, scikit-learn and Keras GPU. These tools are installed in a anaconda environment and ran in a Jupyter notebook.

The complete project implementation is available here: [https://github.com/FlorinGh/SelfDrivingCar-ND-pr3-Behavioral-Cloning](https://github.com/FlorinGh/SelfDrivingCar-ND-pr3-Behavioral-Cloning).
