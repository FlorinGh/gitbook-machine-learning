# 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes Equations

## **Challenge**

use computing capabilities of Python to solve the nonlinear coupled partial derivative equations that govern the dynamics of fluids, the Navier-Stokes equations

## **Actions**

* creating implicit numerical schemes to solve ever increasing difficult simplified parts of the NS equations: linear convection, nonlinear convection, diffusion, Burgers' equation, Laplace equation, Poisson equation
* applying the full final code on two classical problems: cavity flow and channel flow

## **Results**
