# 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes Equations

## **Challenge**

Use computing capabilities of Python to solve the nonlinear coupled partial derivative equations that govern the dynamics of fluids, the Navier-Stokes equations.

## **Actions**

* creating implicit numerical schemes to solve ever increasing difficult components of the NS equations
* linear convection
* nonlinear convection

* diffusion



* Burgers' equation



* Laplace equation



* Poisson equation



* combine all schemes to solve two classical problems:

  * cavity flow



  * channel flow
