# 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes Equations



* **Challenge**: use computing capabilities of Python to solve the nonlinear coupled partial derivative equations that govern the dynamics of fluids, the Navier-Stokes equations
* **Actions**:
  * creating implicit numerical schemes to solve ever increasing difficult simplified parts of the NS equations: linear convection, nonlinear convection, diffusion, Burgers' equation, Laplace equation, Poisson equation
  * applying the full final code on two classical problems: cavity flow and channel flow
