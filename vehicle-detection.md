## **Actions**

* extract features from images using HOG \(histogram of oriented gradients\)
* separate the images in train/test and train an SVM \(support vector machine\) classifier
* implement a sliding window search and classify each window as vehicle or non-vehicle
* output a video with the detected vehicles positions drawn as bounding boxes

## **Results**
