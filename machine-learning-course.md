# Machine Learning Course

## Challenge

Learn the foundations of machine learning.

## Actions

The following concepts were studied:

* **linear regression**: training set, features, target variable, hypothesis, learning algorithm, parameters, cost function, optimisation problem, gradient descent, learning rate, batch gradient descent
* **multivariate linear regression**: feature scaling, mean normalisation, choosing learning rate, normal equation
* **logistic regression**: classification, logistic function, sigmoid function, decision boundary, nonlinear decision boundaries, cost function, optimisation algorithms, multiclass classification, one-vs-all
* **regularisation**: overfitting, regularisation parameter, regularised linear regression, regularised logistic regression
* **neural networks**: computer vision, sigmoid activation function, layers, bias, forward propagation, nonlinear classification, back propagation algorithm, random initialisation
* **model selection**: training / validation / test sets, diagnosing bias and variance, cross validation error, regularisation, learning curves, high bias, high variance
* support vector machines
* dimensionality reduction
* principal component analysis
* k-means clustering
* anomaly detection
* recommender systems
* large scale machine learning

The tool of choice for this course was Matlab; this was used to exemplify the concepts; no training, but learning the theory behind machine learning.

## Results
