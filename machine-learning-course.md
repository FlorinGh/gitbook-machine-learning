# Machine Learning Course

## Challenge

Learn the foundations of machine learning.

## Actions

The following concepts were studied:

* linear regression,
* logistic regression,
* regularisation,
* neural networks,
* support vector machines,
* dimensionality reduction,
* principal component analysis,
* k-means clustering
* anomaly detection
* recommender systems
* large scale machine learning

The tool of choice for this course was Matlab; this was used to exemplify the concepts; no training, but learning the theory behind machine learning.

## Results

As a proof of accomplishment, the following certificate was issued: [https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/WLHZZ6TPVVM2](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/WLHZZ6TPVVM2)â€‹.
