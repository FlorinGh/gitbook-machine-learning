# Advanced Lane Finding

## **Challenge**

Write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video taken while driving on a motorway:

## **Actions**

* compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* apply a distortion correction on the video frames and save a corrected video
* use colour transforms and gradients to create a threshold binary image
* apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image \("birds-eye view"\)
* detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary
* determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to centre of curvature
* warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original perspective
* output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## **Results**
