# Advanced Lane Finding



* **Challenge**:  write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video taken while driving on a motorway
* **Actions**:
  * compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
  * apply a distortion correction on the video frames and save a corrected video
  * use colour transforms and gradients to create a threshold binary image
  * apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image \("birds-eye view"\)
  * detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary
  * determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to centre of curvature
  * warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original perspective
  * output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
* **Results**: [https://github.com/FlorinGh/SelfDrivingCar-ND-pr4-Advanced-Lane-Lines](https://github.com/FlorinGh/SelfDrivingCar-ND-pr4-Advanced-Lane-Lines)
