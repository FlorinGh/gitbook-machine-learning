## Challenge

Train a  convolution neural network to classify traffic signs images using the [German Traffic Sign Data set](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset); with the trained model classify traffic signs from the web.

## Actions

* install anaconda, setup an environment, install pandas, pickle,  tensorflow and openCV
* explore, summarise and visualise the data set
  * the traffic signs data was already split in training, validation and test sets
  * 
* design, train and test a model architecture
* use the model to make predictions on new images
* analyse the softmax probabilities of the new images
