## Self Driving Car - Vehicle Detection Project

* Challenge:  write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video taken while driving on a motorway
* Actions: 
  * extract features from images using HOG \(histogram of oriented gradients\)
  * separate the images in train/test and train an SVM \(support vector machine\) classifier
  * implement a sliding window search and classify each window as vehicle or non-vehicle
  * output a video with the detected vehicles positions drawn as bounding boxes
* Result: [https://github.com/FlorinGh/SelfDrivingCar-ND-pr5-Vehicle-Detection](https://fgheorghe.gitbook.io/machine-learning/~/edit/primary/)
