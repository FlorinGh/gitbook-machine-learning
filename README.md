# Machine Learning Projects

## Self Driving Car - Advanced Lane Finding Project

* Challenge:  write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video taken while driving on a motorway
* Actions:
  * compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
  * Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
  * Use colour transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
  * Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image \("birds-eye view"\).
  * Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
  * Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
  * Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
  * Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Self Driving Car - Vehicle Detection Project](https://fgheorghe.gitbook.io/machine-learning/vehicle-detection)

* Challenge:  write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video taken while driving on a motorway
* Actions: 
  * extract features from images using HOG \(histogram of oriented gradients\)
  * separate the images in train/test and train an SVM \(support vector machine\) classifier
  * implement a sliding window search and classify each window as vehicle or non-vehicle
  * output a video with the detected vehicles positions drawn as bounding boxes
* Results: [https://github.com/FlorinGh/SelfDrivingCar-ND-pr5-Vehicle-Detection](https://github.com/FlorinGh/SelfDrivingCar-ND-pr5-Vehicle-Detection)
